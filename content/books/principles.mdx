I scanned the section on Dalio's life and skipped to his principles. The principles are more like meta-principles on how to prioritize.

Most were too broad to extract actionable insights from, but they were all thought-provoking.

The most valuable idea I extracted from the book was the concept of creating an explicit set of personal principles for decision making. Personal principles are usually implicit and come from inuition - making them explicit is valuable.
