An introduction to the immune system written by the founder of Kurzgesagt that far exceeded by expectations. Philipp Dettmer breaks down this traditionally unapproachable subject so well that it feels simple and intuitive.

He's done a great job sharing his appreciation for the beauty & elegance of the defense systems our bodies have somehow developed through natural selection. He also constantly uses useful analogies and interjects with his own entertaining commentary, making the book highly readable.
