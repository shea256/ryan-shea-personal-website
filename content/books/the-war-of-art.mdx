Anyone who strives to create faces Resistance at some point on their journey. Resistance is what prevents us from achieving what we want to, and it comes in many forms. This book is about how to identify & defeat Resistance.

It presents a unique attitude toward creation that focuses on remembering the nature of Resistance, overcoming it through consistency, and maintaining humility and appreciation for the divinity from which art flows through us.
