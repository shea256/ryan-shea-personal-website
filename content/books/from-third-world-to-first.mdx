Lee Kuan Yew accomplished one of the most impressive feats of all time - he turned Singapore from a third-world to first-world country under his leadership alone.

This book is his reflection on how he did it, with insights on everything from leadership and diplomacy to economics and gardening.

I read the first section about the foundations of each major Singaporean department and learned a lot. I skipped over the rest, which covered Singaporean history and diplomacy.
