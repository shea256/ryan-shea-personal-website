A perfect introduction to the neuroscience of emotions, taught by one of its most insightful teachers.

Panksepp covers emotional systems from a variety of perspectives, laying out neuroanatomical, neurobiological, and neurochemical foundations, while taking into account relevant psychology an philosophy.

This textbook goes far beyond telling the facts. Panksepp also lays out his thought-provoking personal insights and theories.

He often takes a step back from the facts to offer computational and philosophical theories about the brain, appreciate the beauty behind different aspects of neuroscience, or to offer thoughtful reflections on the nature of emotions.
