My rating here is an unpopular opinion, given that Feynman is one of the best physics teachers of all time, and this series is typically considered excellent.

I think I expected more perspective-shifting insight on how to intuitively understand different principles of physics in unique ways, which I found at times, but there was also a substantial amount repetition from standard high-school physics, with similar pedagogical approaches.

My rating is mainly motivated by my expectation of more unique insight characteristic of Feynman, which I didn't find much of in this book. Still a good explanation of the relevant physics.
