After reading _Murder on the Orient Express_ and _And Then There Were None_ I got accustomed to the levels of creativity in those mysteries, which are widely considered to be Agathie Christie's best books.

This one felt more like a regular mystery book - still entertaining and enjoyable, but not at the same level as those books.
