A value dense tactical guide on growing a company from initial success to scale.

Many books focus on how to build something customer's want. Many books focus on how to operate a large company. Few explain how to scale from Series A to IPO, since few people have successfully accomplished this.

Useful insights for early founders to develop awareness of problems they'll face later, although most people need to worry about getting to Series A first. I'll come back and read this book again when I'm in this stage of building a company, and I'm sure the advice will resonate even more.
