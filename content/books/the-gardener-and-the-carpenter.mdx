A book about the philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology of caring for children written by a grandmother who also runs a cognitive and developmental science lab at Berkeley.

Her sentences are full of wisdom, and her mindset toward raising children is beautiful - "loving children doesnâ€™t give them a destination; it gives them sustenance for the journey."

She presents a full picture of the evolutionary roots of parenting and uses this to inform her advice. She does a good job of exploring the nuances of raising children in each age group, and offers perspective on how we can use the science of parenting to improve the education system.
