The defining work on the principles and pscyhology of achievement. This book is famous, but still underrated. It isn't about becoming rich - it's about achieving anything you desire. The philosophy can be applied to building wealth and everything else worthwhile.

It guides you through the thirteen steps to achievement, starting with creating a burning desire for a well-defined future. Each one is an insightful and unintuitive lesson demanding reflection.

Everyone should read and reference this book as many times as necessary for its principles to be fully adopted and applied - they're that critical to success.

If you feel like you're drifting through life without direction, spending your time working toward the dreams of others without your own dream, and you don't want to remain that way, you especially have to read this.
