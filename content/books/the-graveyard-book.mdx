Loved this book in middle school so I decided to read it again. It still has the same dark and uneasy tone, along with the bittersweet inevitability of how Bod's life will need to end up that makes it a nice read.

I didn't like it as much as when I was younger - but maybe because it's easier to appreciate closer to the age and mentality of Bod.
