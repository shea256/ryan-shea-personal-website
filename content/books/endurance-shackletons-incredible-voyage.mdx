A crazy story about grit and the limits of the human will.

It follows the famous crew assembled by Ernest Shackleton to try to make the first succesful expedition across Antarctica - except their boat gets trapped in ice near the beginning of their voyage, and they're forced to survive the brutal Arctic winter.

Stories like these are always a gratitude shock - they put things into perspective for how bad things could be. The book got very slow at points, but still an interesting read.
