Matt Mochary coaches the CEOs of Coinbase, Plaid, Reddit, Brex, OpenAI, Flexport, Rippling, and many more multi-billion dollar tech companies. This book is his guide to being an effective CEO.

The most valuable part is his guide to the individual habits that make a great CEO - he lays out the ideal execution system & best-practices for wellbeing.

The rest of the book provides tactics for running each unit of a startup. He provides a good overview of every important concern, although many of these topics are more thoroughly covered in other tactical startup books.
