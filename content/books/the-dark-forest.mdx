Cixin Liu's biggest strength is his abundance of genuinely insightful & creative ideas that populate his sci-fi worlds. The core concept behind _The Dark Forest_ is genius.

The book struggles in its character development and pacing at times. Its slow to get started with its sci-fi plot, which many people criticize, although I enjoyed Liu's writing in the first half regardless.

It became a slog midway through the book to the point where I didn't want to finish, but I held out to read the ending. There are some plot holes in the build up, but the ending was mind-blowing and worth it.
