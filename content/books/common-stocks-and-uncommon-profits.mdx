One of Warren Buffet's two favorite books on investing. The guide to the most effective and proven strategy for retail investors.

Fisher advocates for a long-term approach where you ignore short-term price action, and focus on identifying a small number of very high quality companies with great management and large growth opportunities, buying them while under-valued, and then never selling.

He shows you how this strategy has always offered the opportunity to make massive returns, and he breaks down the specifics of how to identify great companies and what mistakes to avoid.

Beyond stocks, this book offers timeless insight on investing as a whole and is essential reading for everyone.
