One of the 3 books Jeff Bezos requires all executives at Amazon to read. Also the most painstakingly boring book I've finished in a long time (only finished because I was reading it with a friend).

The book attempts to explain Eliyahu Goldratt's _Theory of Constraints_ philosophy through the fictional story of Alex Rogo, the operator of a failing factory who has three months to turn his business around.

The philosophy itself, which teaches the importance of operational excellence and focusing on bottlenecks, permanently changed managament 30 years ago. However, it's now decades out-dated as its long been the default approach to management.

The narrative is also dragged out far longer than it needs to be, with an irrelevant side plot about the factory owners failing marriage, and every sentence of insight taking several chapters of predictable dialogue to be revealed.
