Life is made up of decisions. Most of these decisions can be evaluated using ordinary decision making frameworks using specific optimization functions.

But some of these decisions - like deciding where to live, who to marry, and what to do with your life - force you to make life-defining choices with incomplete information to questions with no obvious answers.

This book is about how to deal with these "wild problems." It offers great counter-intuitive frameworks on how to make these decisions and what to optimize for to maximize flourishing.

I read it after making a big decision in my life, and all the advice resonated in hindsight. I wish I had read it sooner so I could have made the decision with more confidence.
