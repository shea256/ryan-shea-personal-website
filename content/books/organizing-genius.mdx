A deep dive on exceptional groups and what unifies them all. Covers the stories of the original group at Disney that created _Snow White and the Seven Dwarves_, Xerox PARC, the 1992 Bill Clinton campaign, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works, the school for artists at Black Mountain, and the Manhattan project.

Reading the stories of these groups helps to develop your own intuitions, although I wish the stories were told in more detail. The list of insights at the end about the commonalities between great groups could have used more development.
