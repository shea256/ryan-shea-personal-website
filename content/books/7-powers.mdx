The defining work on business strategy. This book contains an exhaustive list of the business strategies that yield long-term value, framed in the context of benefits offered to incumbents and barriers to competitors.

Beyond it's exploration of strategy, it provides a high-level map of building companies that's often missing in the way startup common knowledge is communicated, and is critical to understanding the big picture.

The examples in this book are concise and strictly add to the main points, which is refreshing compared with the standard unnecessary use of stories in many books.
