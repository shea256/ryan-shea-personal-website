Great book on the theory of intelligence, how its created in the brain, and how we could replicate it in machines. Hawkins gives a great intuitive understanding of many different properties of all brain systems that give rise to intelligence.

Amazingly, while the book was written several decades ago (before significant advancements in AI), many of the most game-changing advances in AI have been due to implementations of the same concepts he elaborates in this book.
