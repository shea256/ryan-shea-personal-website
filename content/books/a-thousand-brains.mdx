An interesting new theory for thinking about how brain systems operate at a high-level. Hawkins argues for the significance of independent cortical-columns in the brain as individual functional units to synthesize information.

The theory seems plausible but unlikely to capture the full picture, which can describe most theories.

I wish the book went into more technical detail on the theory itself and it's implications, but instead only the first third of the book is dedicated to it.

The next two-thirds of the book are Hawkins talking about his theories on AI and the future of humanity, which are unrelated and also a bit incongruous.
