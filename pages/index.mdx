**Some things about me:**

- I'm a founding engineer at [thirdweb](https://twitter.com/thirdweb). We [enable developers](https://thirdweb.com/) to build scalable blockchain applications. We raised our [Series A](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/24/thirdweb-raises-24m-at-a-160m-valuation-from-haun-ventures-shopify-and-coinbase-for-its-web3-development-kit/) last August.
- I'm on a leave of absence from the University of Pennsylvania. I study computer science and neuroscience there.
- I like creating things (writing, coding, startups). Startups are cool because they make creating things profitable & scalable.
- My personal philosophy has changed drastically over the past decade. My current worldview is most aligned with [non-dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism) & [advaita vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advaita_Vedanta).

**Some things I'm interested in:**

- Theories about psychological and philosophical development. Especially [ego development theory](https://www.actualized.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/9-levels-of-ego-development-cook-greuter.pdf) (development of self-awareness) and [spiral dynamics](https://www.amazon.com/Spiral-Dynamics-Mastering-Values-Leadership/dp/1405133562) (development of personal psychology).
- Neuroscience & psychedelics. They combine most of my biggest interests - computation, intelligence, learning, consciousness, philosophy.
- Education, especially for kids under the age of 5, where many critical behaviors are solidifed.
- I like learning about new things, especially from people who are passionate about what they're teaching.
- I like beautiful art of all forms (tv, movies, visual arts, music, games). Good art creates a feeling that can't be replicated by anything else.
